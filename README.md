Abliterix finds the optimal abliteration parameters for any transformer model using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) TPE optimization. It co-minimizes refusals and KL divergence from the original model — producing decensored models that retain as much intelligence as possible.

Works with dense models, multimodal models, MoE architectures, SSM/hybrid models, and vision-language models — with **135+ pre-built configs** covering Llama, Gemma, Phi, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Yi, InternLM, Falcon, Cohere, and more.


## Architecture

Abliterix integrates techniques from **9 peer-reviewed papers** (NeurIPS, ACL, ICLR) into a unified, automated steering pipeline. The table below shows what each technique solves and where it fits:

| Dimension | Problem | Technique | Paper | Config |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **What to remove** | Raw refusal vector is polysemantic — entangles refusal with syntax and capability circuits | **Surgical Refusal Ablation (SRA)** | [Cristofano (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08489) | `vector_method = "sra"` |
| **What to remove** | Single direction misses refusal subspace | **Multi-direction abliteration** | [Glaze et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02132) | `n_directions = 3` |
| **What to remove** | Manual layer/direction selection | **COSMIC** auto-selection | [Siu et al., ACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00085) | `vector_method = "cosmic"` |
| **What to remove** | Mean difference misses distribution shape | **Optimal Transport** matching | [2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.04355) | `vector_method = "optimal_transport"` |
| **Where to steer** | Steering all layers wastes KL budget | **Discriminative Layer Selection** | [Selective Steering (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375) | `discriminative_layer_selection = true` |
| **Where to steer** | Static direction ignores context | **Steering Vector Fields (SVF)** | [2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01654) | `steering_mode = "vector_field"` |
| **How to steer** | Addition-based steering disrupts norms | **Angular Steering** | [Vu & Nguyen, NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243) | `steering_mode = "angular"` |
| **How to steer** | 2D planar rotation ignores hypersphere geometry | **Spherical Steering** (geodesic) | [2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08169) | `steering_mode = "spherical"` |
| **How to preserve** | Standard projection destroys helpfulness signal | **Projected Abliteration** | [grimjim (2025)](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration) | `projected_abliteration = true` |

### Why This Matters

Most abliteration tools implement one or two of these techniques. Abliterix is the only framework that integrates all of them into a single automated pipeline:

- **SRA** cleans the refusal vector so you don't damage math, code, or reasoning capabilities (47x KL improvement on VLMs [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08489))
- **SVF** makes the steering direction adapt per-token, so the same model handles "make a bomb" and "make a cake" differently
- **Spherical Steering** respects the geometric structure imposed by RMSNorm in modern LLMs
- **Discriminative Layer Selection** skips layers where steering would only add noise (15.7x KL reduction [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375))
- **Optuna TPE** automatically finds the optimal combination across all these dimensions — no manual tuning required

The recommended configuration for maximum quality:

```toml
[steering]
vector_method = "sra"
steering_mode = "spherical"
discriminative_layer_selection = true
projected_abliteration = true
```


## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -U abliterix
prometheus --model Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
```

That's it. The process is fully automatic — after optimization completes, you can save the model, upload to Hugging Face, or chat with it interactively.

> **Windows**: use `python scripts/run_prometheus.py --model <model>` or set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` to avoid Rich encoding issues.


## How It Works

Language models learn to refuse harmful queries through specific activation patterns in their residual stream. Abliterix identifies these patterns and surgically removes them:

1. **Compute refusal directions** — pass harmless and harmful prompts through the model, extract per-layer residual activations, and compute the difference vector that characterizes "refusal behavior"
2. **Orthogonalize** — project out the component aligned with normal "good" responses, isolating only the refusal signal
3. **Abliterate via LoRA** — apply rank-1 weight modifications to attention and MLP components, weighted by a kernel function across layers. Changes are captured as lightweight LoRA adapters, not destructively applied to base weights
4. **Optimize** — Optuna's Tree-structured Parzen Estimator searches over kernel shape, fractional direction index, and per-component abliteration strength, selecting Pareto-optimal configurations that minimize both refusals and model degradation


## Results

Abliterated models uploaded to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/wangzhang):

| Model | Refusals | KL Divergence | Trials |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------|
| [LFM2-24B-A2B](https://huggingface.co/wangzhang/LFM2-24B-A2B-abliterated) | **0/100 (0%)** | 0.0079 | 50 |
| [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/wangzhang/GLM-4.7-Flash-abliterated) | 1/100 (1%) | 0.0133 | 50 |

| [Qwen3.5-122B-A10B](https://huggingface.co/wangzhang/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-abliterated) | 1/200 (0.5%) | 0.0115 | 25 |
| [Qwen3.5-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/wangzhang/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-abliterated) | 3/200 (1.5%) | **0.0035** | 50 |

### Key Findings

> **Orthogonalized directions reduced refusals by 67%** compared to raw abliteration in controlled experiments — the single most impactful optimization.

- **Consistent sub-2% refusals across all model sizes** — from 0.8B to 122B, every model achieves 0–1.5% refusal rate. The 0.8B model reaches a perfect 0/200.
- **More trials unlock better parameters** — the 27B improved from 7 to 3 refusals when trials increased from 15 to 35. The 4B dropped from 34 refusals (17%) to just 3 (1.5%) with continued optimization.
- **Per-layer direction index is critical at scale** — for 122B, independently optimizing the refusal direction per layer reduced refusals from 180/200 to 1/200. A single global direction failed entirely.
- **MoE hybrid steering** — combining LoRA abliteration with router weight suppression and fused expert abliteration proved essential for MoE architectures.
- **Non-transformer architectures work too** — LFM2's hybrid conv+attention architecture achieved 0% refusals by steering convolution output projections alongside attention and MLP components.

### Architecture A/B Test (Qwen3.5-0.8B)

Controlled comparison of new techniques vs baseline, grid-searching λ ∈ {0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0} per method and selecting the best Pareto point (lowest refusals → lowest KL). Reproduced across two independent runs.

| Method | Best λ | Refusals | KL | KL vs Baseline |
|--------|--------|----------|-----|----------------|
| A: Baseline (mean+ortho) | 2.0 | 0/100 | 14.000 | — |
| B: Projected (mean+proj+win) | 2.0 | 0/100 | 13.938 | -0.4% |
| **C: Disc. layers** (mean+ortho+disc) | 2.0 | 0/100 | **12.375** | **-11.6%** |
| D: SRA (sra+proj+disc) | 2.0 | 0/100 | 12.813 | -8.5% |
| **E: Spherical** (mean+ortho+sph+disc) | 2.0 | 0/100 | **12.375** | **-11.6%** |
| **F: SVF** (mean+ortho+svf+disc) | 2.0 | 0/100 | **12.375** | **-11.6%** |
| G: Full new arch (SRA+sph+disc+proj) | 2.0 | 0/100 | 12.813 | -8.5% |

**Pareto front**: C, E, F (tied at lowest KL = 12.375)

Key findings from the A/B test:

> **SRA eliminates refusals at 1.9x lower steering strength.** Methods D and G achieve 0 refusals at λ=0.8, while the baseline requires λ=1.5. A cleaner refusal vector needs less force to ablate — which means less collateral damage to model intelligence.

- **Discriminative layer selection is the single biggest KL reducer** — all methods with disc. selection (C/D/E/F/G) beat baseline by 8–12%, confirming the [Selective Steering (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375) paper
- **Every new method outperforms baseline** — worst new method (D/G at -8.5%) still significantly beats baseline and projected-only (-0.4%)
- **SVF trained effective concept scorers on all 24 layers** (accuracy > 60%), with only 2.4s overhead


## Features

### Surgical Refusal Ablation (SRA) *(new)*

Concept-guided spectral cleaning based on [Cristofano (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08489). The raw refusal vector is **polysemantic** — it entangles the refusal signal with syntax, formatting, and capability circuits (math, code, reasoning). SRA builds a registry of *Concept Atoms* from benign activations and uses ridge-regularized spectral residualization to orthogonalize the refusal vector against these protected directions.

**Result**: On Qwen3-VL-4B, standard ablation produces KL = 2.088 while SRA achieves KL = **0.044** — a **47x improvement** — at the same 0% refusal rate.

```toml
[steering]
vector_method = "sra"
sra_base_method = "mean"   # Base method for initial direction
sra_n_atoms = 8            # Number of protected capability clusters
sra_ridge_alpha = 0.01     # Ridge regularization (larger = more conservative)
```

### Spherical Steering *(new)*

Geodesic rotation on the activation hypersphere, inspired by [Spherical Steering (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08169). Modern LLMs use RMSNorm, which makes activation **direction** more salient than magnitude. Spherical steering rotates along the great circle (geodesic) between the current activation and the target direction, respecting this geometric structure.

```toml
[steering]
steering_mode = "spherical"
```

### Steering Vector Fields (SVF) *(new)*

Learned context-dependent steering based on [Steering Vector Fields (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01654). Instead of a static steering direction, SVF trains a small per-layer concept scorer whose gradient `∇_h f(h)` provides a **locally optimal** steering direction at each token position. This makes the intervention adapt to the current context — different tokens get different steering directions.

```toml
[steering]
steering_mode = "vector_field"
svf_scorer_epochs = 50     # Training epochs for concept scorer
svf_scorer_lr = 0.001      # Learning rate
svf_scorer_hidden = 256    # Hidden dimension of scorer MLP
```

### Projected Abliteration

Improved orthogonal projection based on [grimjim's research (2025)](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration). Only removes the component of the refusal direction **orthogonal** to the harmless mean — preserving helpfulness-aligned signals that standard abliteration destroys.

```toml
[steering]
projected_abliteration = true
winsorize_vectors = true
```

### Discriminative Layer Selection

Based on [Selective Steering (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375). Only steers layers where harmful/harmless activations project in **opposite directions**. In A/B tests on Qwen3-0.6B: **15.7x lower KL divergence** vs. baseline.

```toml
[steering]
discriminative_layer_selection = true
```

### COSMIC Direction Selection

Automated direction + layer selection via cosine similarity ([COSMIC, ACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00085)). Finds optimal refusal directions without output text analysis.

```toml
[steering]
vector_method = "cosmic"
```

### Angular Steering

Norm-preserving rotation in activation space ([NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)). Adaptive variant only rotates refusal-aligned activations.

```toml
[steering]
steering_mode = "adaptive_angular"
```

### Optimal Transport & Multi-Direction

[PCA-Gaussian OT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.04355) matches full activation distributions. [Multi-direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02132) ablates top-k independent refusal directions simultaneously.

```toml
[steering]
vector_method = "optimal_transport"   # or use n_directions = 3 for multi-direction
```

### A/B Test Results (Qwen3-0.6B)

| Method | Refusals | KL Divergence | KL vs Baseline |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Baseline (mean+ortho) | 1/100 | 0.01116 | — |
| Projected abliteration | 2/100 | 0.01078 | -3% |
| Discriminative layers | 3/100 | **0.00071** | **-93.6%** |
| COSMIC+proj+disc | 2/100 | **0.00168** | **-84.9%** |

### LLM Judge

Replace keyword-based refusal detection with LLM-powered classification via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for more accurate results, especially for non-English models.

```toml
[detection]
llm_judge = true
llm_judge_model = "google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview"
```

### Smart Optimization

- **Auto batch size** — exponential search finds the largest batch size that fits in VRAM
- **KL divergence pruning** — trials with KL above threshold are terminated early, saving compute
- **Fractional direction index** — interpolates between adjacent layer directions for finer-grained search
- **Per-component parameters** — separate abliteration weights for attention, MLP, and convolution components

## Configuration

Abliterix loads config in priority order (later overrides earlier):

1. [`configs/default.toml`](configs/default.toml) — copy to `abliterix.toml` and customize
2. `AX_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `--config <path>` CLI flag
4. CLI flags (`--model`, `--model.quant-method bnb_4bit`, etc.)

Run `abliterix --help` for all options.

**135+ pre-built configs** in [`configs/`](configs/) — a selection:

| [`noslop.toml`](configs/noslop.toml) | Anti-slop tuning |


## Hardware & VRAM

Abliterix auto-detects available accelerators (CUDA, XPU, MLU, MUSA, SDAA, NPU, MPS) and distributes layers across devices with `device_map = "auto"`.

For large models:
- **4-bit quantization**: `--model.quant-method bnb_4bit` cuts VRAM by ~4x
- **8-bit quantization**: `--model.quant-method bnb_8bit` — higher quality than 4-bit, ~2x VRAM reduction with CPU offload
- **Per-device memory limits**: set `[model] max_memory = {"0": "20GB", "cpu": "64GB"}` in your config
- **Non-interactive mode**: `--non-interactive` for fully automated batch runs


## Research Tools

```bash
pip install -U abliterix[research]
```

- `--display.plot-residuals` — PaCMAP-projected scatter plots and animated GIFs of residual vectors across layers
- `--display.print-residual-geometry` — cosine similarities, norms, silhouette coefficients

Example: PaCMAP visualization shows harmful (red) vs. harmless (blue) activations separating across layers, revealing how the model's refusal circuitry develops through its depth.

## Datasets

Evaluation prompt datasets are available on Hugging Face: [wangzhang/prometheus-datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangzhang/prometheus-datasets)

| Dataset | Count | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `good_500` | 500 | Harmless prompts — recommended for iteration |
| `good_1000` | 1000 | Harmless prompts — full set |
| `harmful_500` | 500 | Harmful prompts — recommended for iteration |
| `harmful_1000` | 1000 | Harmful prompts — full set |

The 500-example sets run ~2x faster than the 1000 sets with no clear quality loss. Abliterix uses these datasets to compute refusal directions and evaluate abliteration effectiveness.
